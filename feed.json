We would like to wholeheartedly thank all of you for your work in making TF2Maps.net into the place it is and wish you all the best in your creative ventures in the future.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #f2f2f5;\"><strong>A huge thank you,</strong></span> from everyone at TF2Maps.net, to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Staff Member <a href=\"https://tf2maps.net/members/suna.28386/\">Suna</a> </li>\n<li>Staff Member <a href=\"https://tf2maps.net/members/blade-x64.5736/\">Blade x64</a> </li>\n<li>Server Mod <a href=\"https://tf2maps.net/members/cincomma.27400/\">Cin</a> </li>\n<li>Server Mod <a href=\"https://tf2maps.net/members/spleep.32645/\">Spleep</a> </li>\n<li>Server Mod <a href=\"https://tf2maps.net/members/xbmann.32101/\">XBMANN</a> </li>\n</ul>\n<p>As is tradition, all of you are receiving a lifetime supply of VIP membership for your service.</p>\n<p>In light of the recent team turnover, we are planning to open Server Moderator applications again soon(-ish), with a focus on users in time zones other than the Americas (sorry, Canada and South America!). If you also have a thing for Public Outreach or Tech (server infrastructure, SourceMod), even better. <em>More on this soon.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<hr>\n<h1>Major Contest 18: Stack the Deck!</h1>\n<p>If you haven't been living under a rock, you may have heard about the <a href=\"https://tf2maps.net/threads/major-contest-18-stack-the-deck.51757/\">18th TF2Maps Contest</a> that only launched a couple of weeks ago! The reception so far has been very good, and the Contest Team is very proud of their work. More on this in an upcoming post.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<hr>\n<h1>Staff Meetings - Rarer than TF Comics?</h1>\n<p>Turns out we had exactly <em>one</em> all-hands-on-deck Team Meeting in the entirety of 2023. You might be pleased to hear that we've already had three this year, and will likely have at least a couple more. There is a lot to things to throw words at, and we are very motivated to also follow up with deeds.</p>\n<p>By the way, one of the general things we spoke about was responsibility of roles in the team. Nesman asks that you stop pinging specifically him whenever you stub your toe on our server infrastructure. We do have an IT role (recently renamed to <code>@THE TECH PEOPLE</code> to make pinging easier), and most issues can be solved by a Server Mod or higher. Let him breathe a bit, folks!</p>\n<p> </p>\n<hr>\n<h1>Imp Hosts and telephone games</h1>\n<p>There have been a handful of reports about a decline in imp host quality in the past months, and we would like to address that.</p>\n<p>First of all, it's on us, not you. We will try to be more hands-on regarding the training and quality control of Hosts. In fact, we are currently working on revamping the whole system with that in mind.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<hr>\n<h1>Copyright, Licensing, Asset Packs</h1>\n<p>While outright asset theft is exceedingly rare in this community (something we're incredibly glad for) we are aware of many users being unsure about their rights and permissions regarding the use or creation of custom assets.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When can you edit an asset?</li>\n<li>When do you need to credit someone?</li>\n<li>How do I credit someone?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some of this <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_bdddKYbvCAgjP6mGBKr0YOKukhak_Z7SviGWYqt5xg/edit\">has been covered before</a>, but we would like to address it in more official terms as well.</p>\n<p>We are also talking to Eminoma, the team behind <a href=\"https://tf2classic.com/\">Team Fortress 2 Classic</a> about this, in case you were interested in using TF2C assets or publishing a map for the mod. Stay tuned for another blog post, as well as some site changes.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<hr>\n<h1>Or whatever it is called now</h1>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--left not_responsive\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://blog.tf2maps.net/media/posts/8/X_logo_2023_white.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" srcset=\"https://blog.tf2maps.net/media/posts/8/responsive/X_logo_2023_white-xs.png 300w ,https://blog.tf2maps.net/media/posts/8/responsive/X_logo_2023_white-sm.png 480w ,https://blog.tf2maps.net/media/posts/8/responsive/X_logo_2023_white-md.png 749w ,https://blog.tf2maps.net/media/posts/8/responsive/X_logo_2023_white-xl.png 1200w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"128\" height=\"128\"></figure>\n<p>In case you didn't notice, our <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tf2maps\"><span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">Twitter</span> X account</a> is active again!

He described how therapeutic it was to be torching players and helping out friendly engineers. That's right, your favorite Valve dev is a Pybro! </span></li>\n<li><span class=\"hljs-emphasis\">His favorite map? A tie between Goldrush and Mercenary Park. A man of taste, if you ask me. </span></li>\n<li><span class=\"hljs-emphasis\">Eric's favorite TF2 update was Scream Fortress VI, which added sd_</span>doomsday<span class=\"hljs-emphasis\">_event and the bumper car minigames. Unsurprisingly, the team had a lot of fun making that one. </span></li>\n<li><span class=\"hljs-emphasis\">As the conversation shifted, I asked a bit about what else he does at Valve. Some of his routine involves reading and responding to emails, Programming work on the game, and doing a bit of work on Steam Deck; specifically the ratings side and working with contractors on that. In the past, he worked on games such as Half-Life: Alyx and, unsurprisingly, TF2! I Was shocked to find out he worked on the original code for the Payload gamemode! </span></li>\n<li><span class=\"hljs-emphasis\">Eric is very aware of all the \"lost\" TF2 media such as the comics. Comic #7 was mentioned, but as far as I can tell, they are not currently working on it. </span></li>\n<li><span class=\"hljs-emphasis\">Eric does read all his emails and tries to get back with people as much as he can. If you have concrete ideas for changes or improvements, consider sending him or the TF Team an email. Eric reads any email that makes it through their admittedly rather aggressive spam filter, even if he doesn't always answer. </span></li>\n<li><span class=\"hljs-emphasis\">Nothing big for TF2 seems planned, mostly maintenance and holiday-sized updates. </span></li>\n<li><span class=\"hljs-emphasis\">People seem to come and go on the TF2 team, but it is generally pretty small these days. </span></li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://blog.tf2maps.net/media/posts/7/goldenthrone-2.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" srcset=\"https://blog.tf2maps.net/media/posts/7/responsive/goldenthrone-2-xs.jpg 300w ,https://blog.tf2maps.net/media/posts/7/responsive/goldenthrone-2-sm.jpg 480w ,https://blog.tf2maps.net/media/posts/7/responsive/goldenthrone-2-md.jpg 749w ,https://blog.tf2maps.net/media/posts/7/responsive/goldenthrone-2-xl.jpg 1200w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"755\" height=\"512\">\n<figcaption >Unfortunately Gabe wasn't in the office that day, but his door was.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em><span style=\"color: #f2f2f5;\"><strong>*</strong></span>All pictures in this article belong to <a href=\"https://tf2maps.net/members/stiffy360.15104/\">Stuffy360</a>.</em></p>\n<p class=\"callout callout__info\">Feedback?

We (the TF2M team) want to share more about what is going on, what we are working on, our thoughts on the community as a whole, and whatever else we can think of.</p>\n\n<h2>Why A Blog?</h2>\n<p>For those of you who have not lived through the Forum Age of the internet and are confused what this even is or why we are doing this now: Blogs are long-form semi-regular publications targeted at a specific or general audience. </p>\n<p>They have more persistence than a Discord announcement, can be longer and more content-filled than a Twitter post, and are more accessible to non-members than a Forum thread. </p>\n<p>This blog is extremely light on resources as it is hosted on Github, making it accessible even when we have hosting issues that make the forums inaccessable. In fact, the (lack of) forum activity TF2Maps gets these days is one motivation for this test run. </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If this feature stays, you may expect some of the following types of posts on here:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Official Announcements: </strong>Anything you would currently see as an announcement post on Discord or on the site frontpage will be posted here as well, possibly with additional context.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Public Service Announcements: </strong>Occasionally, something comes up in the team chat that we think everyone might want to know, but it isn’t worth a full announcement, or it might be too complex for a single Discord message. In fact, one of those came up quite recently.\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><strong><span style=\"font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit;\">Behind the scenes</span></strong><strong style=\"font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit;\">:</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> What is Staff doing right now? \"Whether it’s showing off Pdan's many discarded contest banners, Nesman’s firefighting heroics, or Zeus’ bedroom decoration ideas, we might share some additional things Staff has discussed that you may not have heard of. This could include both official projects as well as things from our lives, especially if it will affect staff availability.</span></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><strong><span style=\"font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit;\">Looking forward</span></strong><strong style=\"font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit;\">: </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Future contests, events, predictions for TF2 Updates or whatever else is coming up will be announced here in advance, as soon as we have an idea ourselves. There’s a lot of people asking when the next Major Contest will be, and even if we don’t have a set date yet, it might make sense to at least announce the vague time frame we have in mind.</span></li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><strong><span style=\"font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit;\">Looking back</span></strong><strong style=\"font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit;\">:</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> TF2Maps is almost as old as TF2 itself. This community has a rich and eventful history. Expect “</span><i style=\"color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);\">today, 10 years ago</i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">” types of posts in which we remember some of the more interesting changes, contests, and perhaps sources of drama that happened here. Some of us have been around for a long time, so why not gather around the campfire and share some tales?</span></li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h2>Your Turn!</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finally, there is one more type of post we would very much like to encourage: </span><strong>Yours!</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p>If there is anything interesting and vaguely TF2Maps-related happening to you, or if there are any projects you would like to talk about in detail, we want to offer <em><span class=\"hljs-strong\">you, esteemed TF2Maps.net community member</span></em>, a platform. We have not fully finalized rules for which posts we are definitely going to allow or disallow, so expect more developments on this as we figure it out ourselves. We might also approach certain community members if we think they have published something we think more people should see. </p>\n<p class=\"callout callout__info\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can subscribe to this Blog via RSS </span><a href=\"https://blog.tf2maps.net/feed.json\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">here</span></a> or if you need it in xml format: <a href=\"https://blog.tf2maps.net/feed.xml\">here </a></p>\n<hr>\n<h2>That's All Folks</h2>\n<p>All this said, <strong><span class=\"hljs-strong\">talk to us!</span></strong> If you have a post idea, or criticism about the whole blog post thing, reach out via @ModMail or <a href=\"https://tf2maps.net/threads/introducing-the-official-tf2maps-blog.51741/\">discuss this article</a> on the forums!! </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, back to Hammer.
