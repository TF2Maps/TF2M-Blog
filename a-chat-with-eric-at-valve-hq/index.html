He described how therapeutic it was to be torching players and helping out friendly engineers. That's right, your favorite Valve dev is a Pybro!</span></li><li><span class="hljs-emphasis">His favorite map? A tie between Goldrush and Mercenary Park. A man of taste, if you ask me.</span></li><li><span class="hljs-emphasis">Eric's favorite TF2 update was Scream Fortress VI, which added sd_</span>doomsday<span class="hljs-emphasis">_event and the bumper car minigames. Unsurprisingly, the team had a lot of fun making that one.</span></li><li><span class="hljs-emphasis">As the conversation shifted, I asked a bit about what else he does at Valve. Some of his routine involves reading and responding to emails, Programming work on the game, and doing a bit of work on Steam Deck; specifically the ratings side and working with contractors on that. In the past, he worked on games such as Half-Life: Alyx and, unsurprisingly, TF2! I Was shocked to find out he worked on the original code for the Payload gamemode!</span></li><li><span class="hljs-emphasis">Eric is very aware of all the "lost" TF2 media such as the comics. Comic #7 was mentioned, but as far as I can tell, they are not currently working on it.</span></li><li><span class="hljs-emphasis">Eric does read all his emails and tries to get back with people as much as he can. If you have concrete ideas for changes or improvements, consider sending him or the TF Team an email. Eric reads any email that makes it through their admittedly rather aggressive spam filter, even if he doesn't always answer.</span></li><li><span class="hljs-emphasis">Nothing big for TF2 seems planned, mostly maintenance and holiday-sized updates.</span></li><li><span class="hljs-emphasis">People seem to come and go on the TF2 team, but it is generally pretty small these days.</span></li></ul><p> </p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.tf2maps.net/media/posts/7/goldenthrone-2.jpg" alt="" width="755" height="512" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" srcset="https://blog.tf2maps.net/media/posts/7/responsive/goldenthrone-2-xs.jpg 300w, https://blog.tf2maps.net/media/posts/7/responsive/goldenthrone-2-sm.jpg 480w, https://blog.tf2maps.net/media/posts/7/responsive/goldenthrone-2-md.jpg 749w, https://blog.tf2maps.net/media/posts/7/responsive/goldenthrone-2-xl.jpg 1200w"><figcaption>Unfortunately Gabe wasn't in the office that day, but his door was.</figcaption></figure><p> </p><p><em><span style="color: #f2f2f5;"><strong>*</strong></span>All pictures in this article belong to <a href="https://tf2maps.net/members/stiffy360.15104/">Stuffy360</a>.</em></p><p class="callout callout__info">Feedback?
