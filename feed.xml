                <p>Hello everyone! Let's talk copyright - again.</p>
<p>To anyone that has used my <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_bdddKYbvCAgjP6mGBKr0YOKukhak_Z7SviGWYqt5xg/edit">How To Not Get Sued</a> document this may not be news, but I have a certain interest in making sure people get credited for their work. I've written quite a bit about this topic and advised people on the use of assets and maps quite a few times now.</p>

<p>This is usually from the asset users' perspective, since the people most unsure about the whole topic are those who are just starting out with mapping and may not have quite gotten the hang of how things work. Also, there simply are vastly more asset consumers than creators out there. As I'm currently doing research about copyright for another mapping-adjacent project, I figured I might use the occasion for a blog post. This article will focus on the other side of the coin: Copyright from the <em>asset creators'</em> perspective.</p>
<hr>
<h1>What is a license?</h1>
<p>Let's make something clear from the start: <strong>If you made something, it's yours.</strong> You don't need to sign, document, publish, pay, notarize, proclaim, prove or otherwise do anything for this to be the case. This provokes the question why you need a copyright license at all. Actually, what even <em>is</em> a license?</p>
<p>Quoting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_copyright_license">Wikipedia</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A <strong>public license</strong> or <strong>public copyright licenses</strong> is a license by which a copyright holder as licensor can grant additional copyright permissions to any and all persons in the general public as licensees. By applying a public license to a work, provided that the licensees obey the terms and conditions of the license, copyright holders give permission for others to copy or change their work in ways that would otherwise infringe copyright law.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In short: By default, the only person allowed to handle things you made is you. While sharing your work with other people on sites like TF2Maps obviously implies that you want other people to interact with it, a copyright license resolves ambiguities and defines specific terms. Most asset creators in the TF2Maps sphere I have interacted with usually have terms like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>You <strong>can</strong> download this asset from the place it is offered.</li>
<li>You <strong>can</strong> pack the asset into a map and share it with others.</li>
<li>If you pack this asset into your map and share it with others, you <strong>must</strong> credit the original creator.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is done because the asset creator obviously wants people to know who made the cool stuff they find in a TF2 map. Early-development maps as seen during our map tests are usually not treated as strictly, but the download page for a finished or almost-finished map should clearly state all authors involved in making it - including asset creators.</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> The Steam Workshop is a special circumstance in this regard. While many mappers treat it as a fast-dl/map sharing service, it is also the place in which maps are offered to Valve for inclusion in official TF2 updates. This process is not automated, unlike with cosmetic items. Instead, Valve sends an email to anyone listed as submission author on the Workshop page. Tragically, there have been several cases of mappers uploading maps to the Workshop without offering author status to all asset creators with the intent of removing their assets once the map is accepted by Valve. I suggest the term "scoop or dupe" for this tactic.</p>
<p>As an asset creator, you can protect yourself by demanding to be listed as an author on any Workshop map that includes your work. In fact, the Steam Workshop's terms and conditions already state this, but who reads them, right? (except me, I guess). See below on how to (optimistically) enforce this.</p>
<hr>
<h1>Why a license?</h1>
<p>"Alright, Brokk", I can hear you say. "I've read this far but I'm getting bored. Can't I just copy the above bulletpoints into a readme.txt and be done with it?"</p>
<p>I mean, yeah; but you've put all this work into creating this cool, uh, crate prop or whatever, so why not spend a few minutes making sure you won't have to fight anyone over it?</p>
<p>For your convenience, I would like to suggest the following ready-made copyright license for you to use:</p>
<h5><a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/">CC BY-NC-ND</a> (Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs)</h5>
<figure class="post__image post__image--right"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://blog.tf2maps.net/media/posts/9/by-nc-nd.png" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" srcset="https://blog.tf2maps.net/media/posts/9/responsive/by-nc-nd-xs.png 300w ,https://blog.tf2maps.net/media/posts/9/responsive/by-nc-nd-sm.png 480w ,https://blog.tf2maps.net/media/posts/9/responsive/by-nc-nd-md.png 749w ,https://blog.tf2maps.net/media/posts/9/responsive/by-nc-nd-xl.png 1200w"  alt="" width="288" height="101"></figure>
<p>This license enables reusers to copy and distribute the material in any medium or format in unadapted form only, for noncommercial purposes only, and only so long as attribution is given to the creator.</p>
<p>Bit of a mouthful, I know. Let me break that down for you:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Creative Commons (CC)</strong> is a non-profit that aims to make creative works more accessible to the public and encourage creators share their work as openly and freely as possible. It is also the name of several copyright licenses. The "commons" in its name refers to the common body of work accessible to all of humanity. Using any Creative Commons license tends to imply that a creator is interested in their work being used widely and freely without any specific input by themselves.</li>
<li><strong>Attribution (BY)</strong>: Means that the author of the work needs to be credited. It also means the license itself needs to be mentioned when crediting, and that any changes to the work (if permitted) need to be indicated. This prevents a game of telephone in which a work becomes unrecognizable and evades credit that way. To be honest, I still haven't figured out what "BY" stands for.</li>
<li><strong>Non-Commercial (NC)</strong>: The work cannot be used commercially. The exact wording is "forbids use that is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or monetary compensation." This is relatively broad on purpose. There are no issues with, for example, taking Ko-Fi donations for publishing maps, but making money directly with the asset is not allowed. Licensing the map to Valve would of course not be permitted, meaning you will need to give your express permission for the asset to be included in a Workshop Submission (which, according to the Workshop terms and services, you have to do anyway).</li>
<li><strong>No Derivatives (ND)</strong>: The work may be distributed, but only in its original form. It may not be changed, remixed, adapted, or transformed. This stops others from claiming authorship on parts of your work in any other way.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can find the full license text, further explanations, and alternative license on the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/">Creative Commons website</a>.</p>
<p>You can license your asset by including <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/legalcode.txt">this text document</a> in the download and mentioning "This asset is licensed under Creative Commons BY-NC-ND 4.0" or similar on the download page.</p>
<p>By the way, if the above license does not completely fit the terms you have in mind, the Creative Commons people also have a nifty <a href="https://chooser-beta.creativecommons.org/">License Chooser</a> that allows you to choose between all of their licenses.</p>
<hr>
<h1>The TF2Maps License?</h1>
<p>By the way, we're also working on something more finely tuned to TF2Maps itself. More on that as it develops, but we want to make a customized version of one of the CC licensed available eventually that allows modellers and mappers to fine-tune how their creations are used. The Creative Commons license has a concept called "<a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/CCPlus">CCPlus</a>" that can be used for this purpose. Some examples follow. Ideally creators will then be able to pick-and-choose the terms from this (uncomplete!) list on which terms they personally want:</p>
<p><strong>Assets:</strong> - No Republishing, except when packed inside of a .bsp file. - No Commercial Use, except for Team Fortress 2's Steam Workshop. - No Commercial Use, except for Team Fortress 2's Steam Workshop and with express permission of the creator(s). - Attribution Required, except when published exclusively for the purposes of testing and iteration on TF2Maps.net. - Attribution Required, and a link to the Asset Pack needs to be supplied. - Attribution Required in the form of a README file inside of the packed .BSP file.</p>
<p><strong>Textures:</strong> - No Derivations, except to the included .VMT files. - Derivations permitted, but attribution still needs to go to the original creator(s).</p>
<p><strong>Maps:</strong> - No Republishing, except for Team Fortress 2 Community Servers ("FastDL"). - No Derivations, except to make the work compatible with another Source Engine Mod (for example, "Team Fortress 2 Classic"). - Attribution Required, except for the content owned by Valve and covered by the Steam Subscriber Agreement.</p>
<hr>
<p>In the long run, we may offer a "standard" license containing a small amount of these terms - how does "The TF2Maps License" sound? Since the TF2M Team does not exactly have the budget for an on-call lawyer, we want to go slowly with this, however. Let us know what you think! As mentioned, we are still working on it.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>

The following constitutes my observations in interaction with the TF2Maps community. I am trying to describe the community's vague consensus and the time-honed customs in handling assets, not some kind of court-approved TF2Maps user agreement. Consider the following my personal, friendly recommendation on how to handle these matters. If something seems unclear, talk to TF2 Maps Staff or the asset creator themselves (yes, this includes Valve, and yes, they do answer their emails, it may just take a while).</span></i></p>

<h1>Goodbye and Hello</h1>
<p>This is a late farewell to the TF2M Team members who left our ranks in the past months. We would like to wholeheartedly thank all of you for your work in making TF2Maps.net into the place it is and wish you all the best in your creative ventures in the future.</p>
<p><span style="color: #f2f2f5;"><strong>A huge thank you,</strong></span> from everyone at TF2Maps.net, to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Staff Member <a href="https://tf2maps.net/members/suna.28386/">Suna</a> </li>
<li>Staff Member <a href="https://tf2maps.net/members/blade-x64.5736/">Blade x64</a> </li>

<li>Server Mod <a href="https://tf2maps.net/members/xbmann.32101/">XBMANN</a> </li>
</ul>
<p>As is tradition, all of you are receiving a lifetime supply of VIP membership for your service.</p>
<p>In light of the recent team turnover, we are planning to open Server Moderator applications again soon(-ish), with a focus on users in time zones other than the Americas (sorry, Canada and South America!). If you also have a thing for Public Outreach or Tech (server infrastructure, SourceMod), even better. <em>More on this soon.</em></p>

<h1>Major Contest 18: Stack the Deck!</h1>
<p>If you haven't been living under a rock, you may have heard about the <a href="https://tf2maps.net/threads/major-contest-18-stack-the-deck.51757/">18th TF2Maps Contest</a> that only launched a couple of weeks ago! The reception so far has been very good, and the Contest Team is very proud of their work. More on this in an upcoming post.</p>
<p> </p>
<hr>
<h1>Staff Meetings - Rarer than TF Comics?</h1>
<p>Turns out we had exactly <em>one</em> all-hands-on-deck Team Meeting in the entirety of 2023. You might be pleased to hear that we've already had three this year, and will likely have at least a couple more. There is a lot to things to throw words at, and we are very motivated to also follow up with deeds.</p>
<p>By the way, one of the general things we spoke about was responsibility of roles in the team. Nesman asks that you stop pinging specifically him whenever you stub your toe on our server infrastructure. We do have an IT role (recently renamed to <code>@THE TECH PEOPLE</code> to make pinging easier), and most issues can be solved by a Server Mod or higher. Let him breathe a bit, folks!</p>
<p> </p>
<hr>
<h1>Imp Hosts and telephone games</h1>
<p>There have been a handful of reports about a decline in imp host quality in the past months, and we would like to address that.</p>
<p>First of all, it's on us, not you. We will try to be more hands-on regarding the training and quality control of Hosts. In fact, we are currently working on revamping the whole system with that in mind.</p>
<p> </p>
<hr>
<h1>Copyright, Licensing, Asset Packs</h1>
<p>While outright asset theft is exceedingly rare in this community (something we're incredibly glad for) we are aware of many users being unsure about their rights and permissions regarding the use or creation of custom assets.</p>
<ul>
<li>When can you edit an asset?</li>
<li>When do you need to credit someone?</li>
<li>How do I credit someone?</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of this <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_bdddKYbvCAgjP6mGBKr0YOKukhak_Z7SviGWYqt5xg/edit">has been covered before</a>, but we would like to address it in more official terms as well.</p>
<p>We are also talking to Eminoma, the team behind <a href="https://tf2classic.com/">Team Fortress 2 Classic</a> about this, in case you were interested in using TF2C assets or publishing a map for the mod. Stay tuned for another blog post, as well as some site changes.</p>

<p>If you've been around for a while, you may have already witnessed our game servers or main site crapping out at an inconvenient moment. We are happy to report that our server provider, Vultr has allowed us to move some of our infrastructure from their New Jersey to California datacenter, which should offer more stability. However if these issues persist we are prepared to do another uplift to different service provider.</p>
<p>In other (tech) news, there have been a bunch of minor improvements to the site itself: Our <a href="https://bot.tf2maps.net/">map testing queue</a> received a makeover and some extra features a while ago, and there have been some minor improvements to the main site as well, which you can read up on <a href="https://tf2maps.net/threads/the-unimportant-announcement-thread.25103/page-6#post-511594">here</a>.</p>

<p>First of all, I'd like to say it was a real pleasure to be able to have a casual conversation with Eric, and his enthusiasm for TF2 shone throughout the talk.</p>
<p>This was not so much a Q&amp;A so much as it was just a casual chat.

<p><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">Eric expressed that Valve was likely to do 2024 and very interested in continuing to do community Summer updates, though they would be smaller in size compared to 2023, which had a <a href="https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Summer_2023_Update">record-breaking amount of new maps</a>. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">He also mention</span><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">ed that there were a </span><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">number of fun things they'd like to do, but weren't necessarily actively being worked on. </span></p>

<h1>Valves Map Selection Process</h1>
<figure class="post__image post__image--left" ><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.tf2maps.net/media/posts/7/gravityguns.png" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" srcset="https://blog.tf2maps.net/media/posts/7/responsive/gravityguns-xs.png 300w ,https://blog.tf2maps.net/media/posts/7/responsive/gravityguns-sm.png 480w ,https://blog.tf2maps.net/media/posts/7/responsive/gravityguns-md.png 749w ,https://blog.tf2maps.net/media/posts/7/responsive/gravityguns-xl.png 1200w"  alt="" width="331" height="220">
<figcaption >The temptation to pick one up look for the nearest sawblade was almost impossible to withstand.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>One of the things I brought up was the criteria maps were subjected to when chosen to be featured in an update.</p>
<p>Eric emphasized that they look through the <em>entire workshop</em> when picking maps, and did not just pick the current "Trending" entries.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Maps for already-added community gamemodes are still being considered, so we may still receive additional <a href="https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Versus_Saxton_Hale">Versus Saxton Hale</a> or <a href="https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Zombie_Infection">Zombie Infection</a> maps.</p>
<p>When picking maps, Valve runs internal playtests with level designers and artists as well to get their feedback on what they enjoyed. A lot of what they look for in a map is how fun it is to play, and whether or not it does something interesting to stand out.</p>

<h1>64 Bit TF2 and Maintenance</h1>

<figcaption >Valve has sold quite a bit of merch over the years.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p> </p>
<p>Theres been a lot of hype about the new 64-bit Team Fortress 2. This effort is mostly being spearheaded by Joshie; a Steam Hardware contractor for Valve and part-time TF2 developer.</p>
<p>This 64-bit update is intended to be more of a maintenance and forward thinking update rather than the start of any big project in itself.</p>
<p>Eric is very excited about what the community has done and is doing, and they're always looking at feedback for improving things such as <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Source-1-Games/issues/4481">vscript</a>.</p>
<p>I had also brought up hybrid gamemodes and he expressed interest in looking into difficulties with hard-coded entities, but it's something that needs to be balanced with time. </p>

<h1>Modding Team Fortress 2</h1>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center" ><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.tf2maps.net/media/posts/7/deckthing.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" srcset="https://blog.tf2maps.net/media/posts/7/responsive/deckthing-xs.jpg 300w ,https://blog.tf2maps.net/media/posts/7/responsive/deckthing-sm.jpg 480w ,https://blog.tf2maps.net/media/posts/7/responsive/deckthing-md.jpg 749w ,https://blog.tf2maps.net/media/posts/7/responsive/deckthing-xl.jpg 1200w"  alt="" width="515" height="343">
<figcaption >Apparently this was used to make the <span class="hljs-string"><a href="https://youtu.be/_vTsZMvjJ-A">Steam Deck Trailer</a></span>. Now it's an art piece in the lobby.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p> </p>
<p>I brought up mod projects related to TF2. <span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">Eric acknowledged that Valve had been working on better support for mods within TF2, as an alternative to outside projects that Valve may object to for intellectual property reasons or violations of the Steam Subscriber Agreement.</span></p>
<p>Eric cited Covid as one of the major reasons work on that had slowed down but was adamant that they were working on it, even going as far as to say he was working on it yesterday (February 20th, 2024).</p>
<p>I do not actually have an idea of what Valve’s mod-related project entails, but Eric's enthusiasm makes me optimistic. </p>
<p> </p>

<h1>Miscellaneous Tidbits about TF2 and Eric</h1>
<p>These are just interesting bits of dialogue and general impressions and do not imply anything deeper </p>
<ul>
<li><span class="hljs-emphasis">Eric is really enthusiastic about TF2 and what the community has done. </span></li>
<li><span class="hljs-emphasis">His favorite class is Pyro. He described how therapeutic it was to be torching players and helping out friendly engineers. That's right, your favorite Valve dev is a Pybro! </span></li>
<li><span class="hljs-emphasis">His favorite map? A tie between Goldrush and Mercenary Park. A man of taste, if you ask me. </span></li>
<li><span class="hljs-emphasis">Eric's favorite TF2 update was Scream Fortress VI, which added sd_</span>doomsday<span class="hljs-emphasis">_event and the bumper car minigames. Unsurprisingly, the team had a lot of fun making that one. </span></li>
<li><span class="hljs-emphasis">As the conversation shifted, I asked a bit about what else he does at Valve. Some of his routine involves reading and responding to emails, Programming work on the game, and doing a bit of work on Steam Deck; specifically the ratings side and working with contractors on that. In the past, he worked on games such as Half-Life: Alyx and, unsurprisingly, TF2! I Was shocked to find out he worked on the original code for the Payload gamemode! </span></li>
<li><span class="hljs-emphasis">Eric is very aware of all the "lost" TF2 media such as the comics. Comic #7 was mentioned, but as far as I can tell, they are not currently working on it. </span></li>
<li><span class="hljs-emphasis">Eric does read all his emails and tries to get back with people as much as he can. If you have concrete ideas for changes or improvements, consider sending him or the TF Team an email. Eric reads any email that makes it through their admittedly rather aggressive spam filter, even if he doesn't always answer. </span></li>
<li><span class="hljs-emphasis">Nothing big for TF2 seems planned, mostly maintenance and holiday-sized updates. </span></li>
<li><span class="hljs-emphasis">People seem to come and go on the TF2 team, but it is generally pretty small these days. </span></li>
</ul>

<p>The TF2Maps Blog is a new, slightly experimental project which we would like to use to improve our interaction with the community.

                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hello, everyone! </span></p>
<p>The TF2Maps Blog is a new, slightly experimental project which we would like to use to improve our interaction with the community. We (the TF2M team) want to share more about what is going on, what we are working on, our thoughts on the community as a whole, and whatever else we can think of.</p>

<h2>Why A Blog?</h2>
<p>For those of you who have not lived through the Forum Age of the internet and are confused what this even is or why we are doing this now: Blogs are long-form semi-regular publications targeted at a specific or general audience. </p>
<p>They have more persistence than a Discord announcement, can be longer and more content-filled than a Twitter post, and are more accessible to non-members than a Forum thread. </p>
<p>This blog is extremely light on resources as it is hosted on Github, making it accessible even when we have hosting issues that make the forums inaccessable. In fact, the (lack of) forum activity TF2Maps gets these days is one motivation for this test run. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If this feature stays, you may expect some of the following types of posts on here:</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>Official Announcements: </strong>Anything you would currently see as an announcement post on Discord or on the site frontpage will be posted here as well, possibly with additional context.</li>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>Public Service Announcements: </strong>Occasionally, something comes up in the team chat that we think everyone might want to know, but it isn’t worth a full announcement, or it might be too complex for a single Discord message. In fact, one of those came up quite recently.
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><strong><span style="font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit;">Behind the scenes</span></strong><strong style="font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit;">:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> What is Staff doing right now? "Whether it’s showing off Pdan's many discarded contest banners, Nesman’s firefighting heroics, or Zeus’ bedroom decoration ideas, we might share some additional things Staff has discussed that you may not have heard of. This could include both official projects as well as things from our lives, especially if it will affect staff availability.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li aria-level="1"><strong><span style="font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit;">Looking forward</span></strong><strong style="font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit;">: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Future contests, events, predictions for TF2 Updates or whatever else is coming up will be announced here in advance, as soon as we have an idea ourselves. There’s a lot of people asking when the next Major Contest will be, and even if we don’t have a set date yet, it might make sense to at least announce the vague time frame we have in mind.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><strong><span style="font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit;">Looking back</span></strong><strong style="font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit;">:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> TF2Maps is almost as old as TF2 itself. This community has a rich and eventful history. Expect “</span><i style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">today, 10 years ago</i><span style="font-weight: 400;">” types of posts in which we remember some of the more interesting changes, contests, and perhaps sources of drama that happened here. Some of us have been around for a long time, so why not gather around the campfire and share some tales?</span></li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Your Turn!</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, there is one more type of post we would very much like to encourage: </span><strong>Yours!</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p>If there is anything interesting and vaguely TF2Maps-related happening to you, or if there are any projects you would like to talk about in detail, we want to offer <em><span class="hljs-strong">you, esteemed TF2Maps.net community member</span></em>, a platform. We have not fully finalized rules for which posts we are definitely going to allow or disallow, so expect more developments on this as we figure it out ourselves. We might also approach certain community members if we think they have published something we think more people should see. </p>
