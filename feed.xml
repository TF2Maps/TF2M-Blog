                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hello mappers! We are starting 2024 with a team meet-up discussing our plans for the year. There are various projects coming up, some public, some not. You may have already seen Nesman’s improvements to our map queue (</span><strong>bot.tf2maps.net</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">), which has been completely rewritten, as well as the discussions a few weeks ago about the </span><strong>Featured Maps</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> event. There is a lot to talk about, but if there is anything that is especially close to your heart, let us know so we can add it to the agenda. We can’t promise we will talk about </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">everything</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but we will at the very least consider it. Cheers!</span></p>
